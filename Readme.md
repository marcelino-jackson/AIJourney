# AI Journey - Marc

Welcome to my public playground for diving headfirst into AI and LLMs. This repo is where I turn lessons from courses into working code, focusing on LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, Snowflake, and eventually fine-tuning my own models. I'm a DevSecOps engineer leveling up to an AI/LLM role, and this is the proof—experiments, projects, and all the bugs that come with learning.

## What's Here

- **LangChain**: Building blocks for AI apps, chaining LLMs with tools and memory.
- **LangGraph**: Stateful agents that think, act, and loop like real workflows.
- **MCP**: Data pipelines and cloud integrations, tying AI to real-world systems.
- **Snowflake**: Data warehousing for scalable, AI-ready datasets.
- **Future Plans**: CrewAI, custom LLM training, and more as I progress.

Everything's coded in Python, managed with UV for clean dependencies, and built in PyCharm for that sweet workflow. Expect notebooks, scripts, and demos—some polished, some raw. This isn't just a portfolio; it's my learning log, open for collaboration.

## Why Public?

I believe in learning out loud. If you're a dev or recruiter, you'll see my process: how I break things, fix them, and ship working AI. Fork it, suggest fixes, or just watch me grow. Contributions are welcome—let's build something cool.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install UV, and dive into any folder. Each has its own README with context—what it does, what I learned, and what broke. Check back often; I'm adding new projects monthly as I tackle more courses.
